5- Write a program that contains three functions that compute the sum of the 
numbers in a list. The first function uses for loop, the second function uses while 
loop and the third function uses recursion. 
Input: 
2 lines, the first contains integer, n, representing the size of the list (how many 
numbers in the list) 
The second consists of n space-separated integers, representing the numbers in 
the list 
Output: 
The output should be on three lines: the first line is the output of the first function, 
the second is for the second function and the third is for the third function. 

EX: 
Input:
