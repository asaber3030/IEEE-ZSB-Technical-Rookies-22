7- Modify the previous program such that only multiples of three or five are 
considered in the sum. 
EX:
 
Input: 
15 
Output: 
60 
Explanation: 
Only numbers (3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15) as (3, 6, 9, 12) are multiples of 3 and (5, 10, 
15) are multiples of 5. So the answer will be 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 = 60
