8- Write a guessing game. The program will generate a random number between 
1 and 10 and ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 10. If they don't 
make the correct guess the program will ask them to enter another number and 
so on. Until they get it right, the program will print the number of the tries they 
needed to answer correctly
